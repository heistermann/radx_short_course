Radx Short Course 
=================

This repository is thought to hold material which can
be used as a Radx introduction based on the IPython notebook.

The basic idea is to call Radx applications from the IPython notebook and
then analyse the results using python, ideally via Py-ART or wradlib.

Right now, the repository only contains some sample data and a sample notebook.

Additions welcome...
